# Real Estate Intelligence Platform - Backend API

## ⚠️ PROJECT STATUS: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - BACKEND ONLY

This is a **private, internal-only** real estate data platform designed for investment analysis and property management. Currently building the backend infrastructure before any public-facing components.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform real estate investment decisions through comprehensive data aggregation, analysis, and management tools. This platform will:

1. **Aggregate** real estate data from multiple sources (NYC Open Data, Zillow, Census)
2. **Analyze** market trends and investment opportunities
3. **Manage** property portfolios and performance tracking
4. **Alert** on market changes and opportunities

## 🏗️ Current Phase: Backend Infrastructure

We are **intentionally** building the backend first:
- ✅ PostgreSQL database design
- ✅ Next.js API routes (private, authenticated)
- ✅ Basic project setup and configuration
- ❌ Data ingestion pipelines (next phase)
- ❌ Frontend (postponed until backend is stable)
- ❌ Public API (never - this is internal only)

## 🚨 Critical Principles

1. **INTERNAL ONLY** - No public endpoints, ever
2. **DATA PRIVACY** - All data is proprietary and confidential
3. **SECURITY FIRST** - Authentication required for all access
4. **PRAGMATIC DESIGN** - Build what we need, when we need it
5. **DEVILS ADVOCATE** - Challenge every architectural decision

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router, API routes only)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **ORM**: Prisma (type-safe database access)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT
- **Validation**: Zod (runtime type checking)
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 15+ running locally or accessible remotely
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
cd re_platform
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your database connection string

# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Create database and run migrations
npm run db:push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Verify Setup

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Should return:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "database": "connected"
  }
}
```

## 📊 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript compiler
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate Prisma client
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema to database
- `npm run db:migrate` - Create and run migrations
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio

## 🧪 Current Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - Health check and system status

## 📋 Next Development Steps

1. **Authentication System** - User management and JWT tokens
2. **Property CRUD** - Basic property data operations
3. **Data Validation** - Zod schemas for all inputs
4. **Error Handling** - Consistent error responses
5. **Testing Suite** - Unit and integration tests

## 🤔 Questions to Always Ask

Before implementing any feature, ask:
1. Does this solve a real problem we have TODAY?
2. Is this the simplest solution that works?
3. Will this scale when we 10x our data?
4. What are the security implications?
5. What's the maintenance burden?

**Remember**: We're building a tool to make money in real estate, not to win architecture awards. Stay focused on delivering value.
