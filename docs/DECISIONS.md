## 2024-01-15 - Abandon Frontend for Backend-First Approach

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Current frontend is incomplete with hardcoded data, broken calculations, and no real data persistence. We need a robust data platform for investment decisions.

**Options Considered**:
1. Fix current frontend and add database later
2. Build backend first, then rebuild frontend
3. Develop both in parallel

**Decision**: Build backend first (Option 2)

**Rationale**: 
- Current frontend is essentially throwaway code
- Need solid data foundation before building features
- Parallel development would slow both efforts
- Backend-first ensures we have real data to work with

**Consequences**: 
- No user-facing features for 4-6 weeks
- Can focus on getting data model right
- Will have accurate data when rebuilding UI

**Review Date**: 2024-03-01

## 2024-01-15 - PostgreSQL Over NoSQL

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to choose primary database for financial data, property records, and user information.

**Options Considered**:
1. PostgreSQL - Relational database
2. MongoDB - Document database
3. DynamoDB - Key-value store

**Decision**: PostgreSQL

**Rationale**:
- ACID compliance critical for financial data
- Strong consistency requirements
- Complex queries and relationships
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Team familiarity

**Consequences**:
- Must design schema carefully upfront
- Migrations will require planning
- Can leverage powerful SQL features
- Type safety with Prisma ORM

**Review Date**: 2024-07-01

## 2024-01-15 - Next.js API Routes vs Separate API

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to decide how to structure our backend API while keeping everything internal and secure.

**Options Considered**:
1. Next.js API routes within same project
2. Separate Express/Fastify API server
3. GraphQL server

**Decision**: Next.js API routes

**Rationale**:
- Single deployment unit
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Integrated authentication
- No CORS issues (same origin)
- Simpler infrastructure

**Consequences**:
- API and future frontend in same codebase
- Must organize code carefully
- Limited by Next.js constraints
- Easier deployment and maintenance

**Review Date**: 2024-04-01

## 2024-01-15 - Monolith Over Microservices

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Architecture pattern for the overall system.

**Options Considered**:
1. Monolithic application
2. Microservices architecture
3. Serverless functions

**Decision**: Monolith

**Rationale**:
- Small team (potentially one developer)
- Faster initial development
- Easier debugging and testing
- Lower operational complexity
- Can split later if needed

**Consequences**:
- All code in one repository
- Single deployment pipeline
- Shared database transactions
- Must maintain modular code structure

**Review Date**: 2024-12-01

## 2024-01-15 - JWT Authentication

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need secure authentication for internal users without public access.

**Options Considered**:
1. JWT tokens with NextAuth.js
2. Session cookies
3. OAuth with external provider
4. API keys only

**Decision**: JWT with NextAuth.js

**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication
- Works well with API routes
- Built-in Next.js support
- Can add providers later
- Secure for internal use

**Consequences**:
- Must handle token refresh
- Need secure secret management
- 24-hour token expiration
- No need for session storage

**Review Date**: 2024-06-01

## 2024-01-15 - No Docker Initially

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Original plan included Docker from day one.

**Options Considered**:
1. Dockerize everything immediately
2. Local development first, Docker later
3. Docker for database only

**Decision**: Local development first (Option 2)

**Rationale**:
- Faster iteration during development
- Avoid complexity while prototyping
- Can add Docker when deploying
- Focus on features over infrastructure

**Consequences**:
- Must document local setup clearly
- May have environment inconsistencies
- Will need Docker before production
- Simpler onboarding for now

**Review Date**: 2024-02-15

## 2024-01-15 - Prisma as ORM

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need type-safe database access with good developer experience.

**Options Considered**:
1. Prisma
2. TypeORM
3. Drizzle
4. Raw SQL with pg library

**Decision**: Prisma

**Rationale**:
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Auto-generated types from schema
- Built-in migration system
- Large community support
- Good documentation

**Consequences**:
- Must learn Prisma schema syntax
- Some limitations vs raw SQL
- Vendor lock-in risk
- Great developer experience

**Review Date**: 2024-07-01

## 2024-01-15 - API Versioning Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to version our API for future changes.

**Options Considered**:
1. URL versioning (/api/v1/)
2. Header versioning
3. No versioning (internal only)

**Decision**: URL versioning

**Rationale**:
- Most explicit and clear
- Easy to route different versions
- Simple to deprecate old versions
- Industry standard approach

**Consequences**:
- All routes prefixed with /api/v1/
- Must maintain old versions temporarily
- Clear upgrade path for clients
- Easier testing of versions

**Review Date**: 2024-12-01

## 2024-01-15 - Manual Data Entry First

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to get data into system before building automated pipelines.

**Options Considered**:
1. Build automated ETL first
2. Manual admin interface first
3. Direct database inserts

**Decision**: Manual admin interface

**Rationale**:
- Understand data requirements first
- Validate data model with real use
- Faster to initial value
- Can automate based on learnings

**Consequences**:
- Need basic CRUD interface
- Manual work initially
- Better understanding of data needs
- Automation becomes clearer

**Review Date**: 2024-02-01

## 2024-01-15 - No Public Endpoints

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Security model for the platform.

**Options Considered**:
1. Public read endpoints with auth for write
2. Everything requires authentication
3. API keys for some endpoints

**Decision**: Everything requires authentication

**Rationale**:
- All data is proprietary
- Simpler security model
- No risk of data leaks
- Internal tool only

**Consequences**:
- Must authenticate every request
- No public API documentation
- Simpler security implementation
- No anonymous access ever

**Review Date**: Never - This is permanent

## Decision Reversal Process

If a decision needs to be reversed:

1. Document why the original decision failed
2. Analyze impact of reversal
3. Create migration plan
4. Update this log with new decision
5. Mark original as "Superseded"
6. Link to new decision

**Remember**: Good decisions can be changed. Bad decisions that can't be changed are disasters. Always build in escape hatches.
